- A single division contains all units of one side(including units that exist only in general mode)
- Supply trucks heal all units
- More resupply
- Any unit of any stage of any rank is available
- 100 units on 1 card
- Economy enhancements

Not all transports are added, because there are too many
No differentiation of the load of transport vehicles, watch yourself

DLC units need DLC (probably, after all, I bought all)
