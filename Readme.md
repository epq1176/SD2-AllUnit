SD2 All Unit Mod
- A single division contains all units of one side(including units that exist only in general mode)
- Supply trucks heal all units
- More supplies, larger supply range
- Any unit of any stage of any rank is available
- 100 units on 1 card
- Economy enhancements

DLC units need DLC (probably, after all, I bought all)

Attention: Due to Github's 100mb file limit, the UniteDescriptor.ndf was packaged as a .7z archive!
